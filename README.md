# Code and content for the Data Science Wiki: pruned.io:

**[www.pruned.io](https://www.pruned.io)** - *An exploration through the world of Data Science...*


# What is this wiki about?

This wiki is about the broad topic of Data Science and will, over time, (hopefully) cover articles around Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Visualization, Coding, Statistics, Linear Algebra, etc.

I say "hopefully", because I am new to this domain and started exploring only recently through books, feeds, podcasts, online courses and personal projects. I have been keeping notes in several, sometimes unstructured ways and as I started putting more structure to my scribbles, I though this reference material I am building up could benefit others who have an interest in this domain, which leads me to answering the following question...

# Why this wiki?

Data Science is a huge topic and many people mean different things with the term by itself. However, one has to start somewhere, building a certain basic understanding and getting a grasp of the vastness of the topic and to determine a direction, or multiple directions to explore. With this wiki I am trying to put something together, as I go on this path, which I would have loved to have had, when I started out - which is just about now ;)
